        <q><i>Contact</i> is made in any actual <i>present situation</i>, 
        the only moment in which experience and change are possible.</q>

        <q>Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation and 
          that is an act of political warfare.</q> <br><i>Audre Lorde</i>

      <p>
        <q>To truly love we must learn to mix various ingredients - care, affection, 
          recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as honest and open 
          communication.</q> <br><i>bell hooks, All About Love: New Visions</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <q>Separateness is a precondition for connection: this is the essential 
          paradox of intimacy and sex.</q> <br><i>Esther Perel, Mating in Captivity</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <q>The body, not the thinking brain, is where we experience most of our pain, 
          pleasure, and joy, and where we process most of what happens to us. It is also 
          where we do most of our healing, including our emotional and psychological healing. 
          And it is where we experience resilience and a sense of flow.</q>
