      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <q>I have been seeing Caz for two years and it has made such a positive 
        impact in my life. Caz is skilled at creating a safe therapeutic space 
        where I feel comfortable to bring any issue or feeling that I am struggling with. 
      
      <p>
        She is warm, gentle, kind, nonjudgmental and an amazing listener. She 
        remembers things (in great detail) that I have brought up months earlier. 
        This makes me feel very cared for. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoy the very 'human' and 'whole' therapeutic approach she has. 
        It is a varied experience each week and we have used many different techniques 
        and tools. I can utilise what I have learnt with Caz in my day-to-day life, 
        and this helps me cope with stressful or triggering situations in a more effective way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel understood and have seen many improvements in my life, specifically 
        with disordered eating, relationships and my self-worth. 
      </p>
        Thank you!</q>

      <q>I've been having therapy with Caz since more than few years, now. Our work 
        together started when I used to live in London, and I strongly wanted to continue 
        the work together after I moved to Italy, almost two years ago. Caz is very 
        meticulous and reliable. I feel really comfortable talking to Caz and during 
        the years we built a mutual trust. When I do therapy with Caz I feel in a 
        dimension where there is space for Myself, with a capital “M”, without filters, 
        and I feel I could talk about any of my thoughts.
        <p></p>
        As said above, even after moving back to Italy, I wanted and decided to continue 
        therapy with Caz as I made with her a lot of progresses in the a life-long journey 
        of continuous personal improvement. I wish Caz could be my therapist in many years 
        to come, as I always found beneficial working together.</q>
