        I have been seeing Caz for two years and it has made such a positive 
        impact in my life. Caz is skilled at creating a safe therapeutic space 
        where I feel comfortable to bring any issue or feeling that I am struggling with.

      <p>
        She is warm, gentle, kind, nonjudgmental and an amazing listener. She 
        remembers things (in great detail) that I have brought up months earlier. 
        This makes me feel very cared for. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I really enjoy the very 'human' and 'whole' therapeutic approach she has. 
        It is a varied experience each week and we have used many different techniques 
        and tools. I can utilise what I have learnt with Caz in my day-to-day life, 
        and this helps me cope with stressful or triggering situations in a more effective way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel understood and have seen many improvements in my life, specifically 
        with disordered eating, relationships and my self-worth. 
      </p>

        Thank you!
