This is my second voluntary project, to help kick start\
the career of a fledgling Gestalt therapist.

Using what I have learned from jon-edis-osteopath, I have\
created a boilerplate respository called hand-made-by-wiggins\
which I have used to start off this project. I expect it to\
take shape nice and rapidly in consultation with my new client.

Here is a draft of the site so far, pending client feedback:
